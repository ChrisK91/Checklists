Glucose levels are usually moderately elevated, however they can range from normal/slightly increased levels (euglycemic states) to high levels exceeding 900 mg/dl in comatose patients. The treatment relies on fluid &amp;amp; electrolyte replacement, insulin administration and glucose administration.
Guidelines of from different regions have variations in therapy, for instance the ADA suggests half-isotonic (0.45 %) saline in the fluid replacement regime, the Joint British Diabetes Society and the German guideline recommend 0.</description></item><item><title>Protective lung ventilation</title><link>https://medist.org/checklists/protective_lung_ventilation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://medist.org/checklists/protective_lung_ventilation/</guid><description>General Protective lung ventilation aims for low tidal volume ventilation. A large study has shown a decrease in mortality, when patients with acute lung injury/ARDS were ventilated with low tidal volumes. Today, the protective lung ventilation algorithm by the ARDS network provides a reasonable default approach for mechanically ventilated patients, especially those at risk for developing ARDS
