Here I collect a variety of medical checklists. They come from a variety of sources, including articles, books, and personal experience.

For obvious reasons, you should not rely on these lists alone, as I cannot guarantee that they will always be correct. This page is very much a work in progress. If you are interested in the source code used to generate these files, you can find them via the GitHub-Button.

The name of the sites comes from **med**ical checkl**ist**.
