This page contains a list of links and books that I use to research stuff. Not everything here is free.

## General resources

- **[deranged physiology](https://derangedphysiology.com/)** provides great overviews over a lot of medical topics.
- **[life in the fast lane](https://litfl.com/)** is another great free resource, covering a wide range of topics. Apart from the great ICU topics, you will also find an extensive ECG library over there

## Books

- **[Das ICU Buch](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9783437231629/das-icu-buch)** a German book covering ICU topics. The book often presents the relevant physiologic considerations and provides insight from recent studies
- **[Internistische Intensivmedizin f√ºr Einsteiger](https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783662618226)** another German book. This one is (in my opinion) a bit more practical and more to the point.

## Websites, Apps and Tools

- **[calculate by qxmd](https://qxmd.com/calculate)** contains every calculator that you ever wanted
- **[diagnosia](https://www.diagnosia.com/)** information on drugs and dosing for Germany/Austria. You can also check for interactions. They provide a sleek mobile application, which however requires internet connectivity to display everything.
- **[dosing.de](https://www.dosing.de/)** a German site providing information about dosing adjustment in renal failure.
