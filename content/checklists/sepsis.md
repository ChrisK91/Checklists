## qSOFA

high score = high risk
- GCS < 15
- breathing frequency >= 22/min
- systolic bp <= 100 mmHg

## Early management

- i.v. volume and circulatory support, MAP >= 65 mmHg
- get samples
- start empiric antibiotics
  - first doses is a normal dose, even in renal failure
  - aim for application within max. 30 minutes!
- central venous catheter, arterial cathether
- treat the focus (change lines/catheter, surgery, etc...)

## Volume management

- Isotonic crystalloids:
  - 30 ml/kg KG in hypotension and lactate >= 4 mmol/l
  - careful administration in heart failure
- Circulatory support
  - Noradrenaline: first choice, the maximum rate of 1.5 mg/h is sometimes exceeded
  - Vasopressin: higher risk for ischemia, common dose 0.03 units/h
  - Dobugtamine: inotropic, consider in heart failure, 150 - 600 Âµg/kg weight/h
  - Adrenaline: inotropic

## Further considerations

- consider steroids if high circulatory support is needed
  - e.g. 200 mg hydrocortisone
- dialysis in acute renal failure
- intubation with sedation in respiratory failure
- transfusion with Hb < 7 g/dl
- nutrition
  - start when haemidynamic stability is reached
  - don't lower blood glucose too aggressively, aim for 140 - 180 mg/dl
