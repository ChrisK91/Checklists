Adrenal crisis describes an acute adrenal insufficiency, often presenting as hypotension refractory to fluids and vasopressors.

## Causes

- **chronic adrenal insufficiency**
  - most often in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency, can also occur in secondary and tertiary insufficiency
  - triggers:
    - increased demand for glucocorticoids (infection, surgery, trauma, ...)
    - abrupt withdrawal of exogenous glucocorticoids
- **acute adrenal insufficiency**
  - pituitary infarction
  - acute adrenal gland destruction (hemorrhage, trauma)

## Presentation

- volume depletion and hypotension, often refractory to fluids and vasopressors
- nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain
- reduced consciousness, delirium

- **laboratory findings**
  - hyperkalemia (in primary adrenal insufficiency)
  - **hyponatremia**
  - possibly hypercalcemia, hypoglycemia

## Management

- primary measures:
  - establish i.v. access, measure serum electrolytes, glucose, cortisol and ACTH
    - do not wait for laboratory results, hormones values are used to confirm diagnosis later
      - normal cortisol (> 20 Âµg/dl) excludes adrenal insufficiency, lower values require further confirmation (i.e. ACTH test)
  - replace fluids
    - 1 to 3 liters i.v. fluid (saline or isotonic)
      - **don't** give hypotonic saline (worsens hyponatremia)
    - dextrose to correct hypoglycemia
  - hydrocortisone
    - 100 mg bolus
    - followed by 50 mg every 6 hours *or* 200 mg/24h continuous
- secondary measures:
  - search and treat underlying trigger
  - perform ACTH-test, determine type of adrenal insufficiency
  - taper i.v. glucocorticoid to oral medication, if possible

- Patients should improve rapidly and considerably with steroid and volume replacement
- Consider prevention strategies in patients with known adrenal insufficiency, e.g. doubling or tripling of maintenance steroid dose in infection/surgery/etc.
