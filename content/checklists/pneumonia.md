## Classification

- community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acquired outside of hospital
- nosocomial pneumonia, acquired in hospital, further subdivided into
  - hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), acquired >= 48 hours after admission
  - ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acquired >= 48 hours after intubation

Therapeutic decisions are further guided by immunocompetence, with immunocompromised patients having different potential pathogens, including fungal infections, parasites and uncommon viral/bacterial species.

## Diagnosis

- history with fever, cough, dyspnea and sputum production
- vital signs including blood pressure, breathing rate, SpO2, mental state (GCS)
  - calculate [qSOFA]({{< relref "sepsis#qsofa">}}) score
- laboratory findings
  - leukocytosis, early sign
  - elevated CRP, can lag behind leukocytes
  - elevated PCT is highly specific for bacterial infections
  - urea is needed for CURB-65 score
- arterial blood gases for respiratory insufficiency
- auscultation
- imaging
  - chest X-ray can often identify consolidations/infiltrates/cavitations
  - CT can provide further clarification in inconclusive or negative radiographs
  - ultrasound can identify pleural effusions  

### Microbiological testing

- blood cultures
- sputum cultures/stain
- urinary testing for S. pneumoniae
- testing for Legionella spp. (PCR or urinary antigen test)
- viral testing (SARS-CoV-2, influenza and other seasonal viruses depending on season)
- *severe pneumonia:* bronchoscopic samples
- tuberculosis and fungi in cavitary pneumonia
- *consider extended spectrum of pathogens (including fungi, uncommon viruses, Pneumocystis jirovecii, etc.) in immunocompromised patients*

## Further management

- CURB-65 score
  - C = confusion
  - U = urea > 7 mmol/L (= 19,6 mg/dL)
  - R = respiratory rate >= 30/min
  - B = blood pressure, diastolic <= 60 mmHg/systolic < 90 mmHg
  - 65 = age >= 65
- [PSI-Score]({{< relref "calculators/pneumonia">}})

- CURB-65 > 1 or PSI-Score >= III: hospitalize patient
- CURB-65 >= 3 or PSI-Score V consider intensive care

## Therapy

- CAP
  - outpatient:
    - amoxicillin (addition of macrolide is sometimes recommended)
    - amoxicillin-clavulanate plus macrolide can be considered in smokers or patients with comorbidities
  - hospitalized patients:
    - beta-lactam antibiotic, addition of macrolide is sometimes recommended. Alternatively fluoroquinolones can be considered (monotherapy)
    - check history for recent antibiotics or prior infections with Pseudomonas, consider antipseudomonal beta-lactam (piperacillin-tazobactam, etc.)
    - in known/suspected MRSA infection consider vancomycin or linezolid
- HAP/VAP
  - therapeutic decisions should be guided by local distribution of pathogens, use local guidelines for antibiotic therapy
  - account for risk for multi drug resistant pathogens
    - recent IV antibiotics
    - long hospitalization
    - patient history
  - account for risk for MRSA
    - based on local distribution of pathogens
    - previous history of MRSA
