AKI = acute kidney injury is classified further into prerenal, renal, postrenal

## Diagnostic criteria

- RIFLE
- AKIN
- doesn't account for non-oliguric states

## Diagnostic approach

- Ultrasound
  - postrenal obstruction
  - prerenal: low volume
- Blood
  - Na, K (and pH can easily be tested with ABG)
  - Creatinine, BUN/Urea
  - Cystatin C
  - specific antibodies in autoimmune AKI
  - ...
- Urine
  - Urinalysis
  - Osmolarity
  - Na/Urea, Creatinine
    - low Na indicates prerenal cause
    - Used to calculate fractional excretion of sodium or urea
      - fractional excretion of sodium < 1 %: prerenal, > 2 % renal, cannot be used with diuretics
      - fractional excretion of urea < 35 % prerenal, > 50 % renal, not influenced by diuretics

## Therapy

- improve renal perfusion
- stop nephrotoxic medications
  - NSAIDs, aminoglykosides, ACE-inhibitors, AT-receptor blockers, etc.
- treat underlying causes
- furosemide does not improve renal function or revert oliguric kidney failure. Can be used to reduce volume/sodium.
