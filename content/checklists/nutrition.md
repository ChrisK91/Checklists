## Phases of critical illness

- early acute, day 1-2: catabolism
- late acute, day 4-7: lower catabolism
- reconvalescence, > day 7: increase of anabolism
- or chronic: persisting catabolism

## General

- establish current status (NUTRIC Score, MUST Score, etc.)
- caloric need/day (acute phase)
  - BMI < 30: 24 kcal/kg weight (= current weight)
  - BMI 30-50: 11-14 kcal/kg weight (= current weight minus hyperhydration)
  - BMI > 50: 22-25 kcal/kg weight (= ideal weight)
- caloric need (reconvalescence)
  - BMI < 30: 36 kcal/kg
  - BMI > 30: individual goal, consult nutritionist  
- caloric need (special cases)
  - sever burns: 40 kcal/kg
  - liver failure: 35-40 kcal/kg
  - malnutrition: 25-30 kcal/kg

## Acute phase (Parenteral)

- start with 75 % of calculated caloric need
- check glucose regularly
  - high glucose: reduce caloric intake to 25 to 50%
  - normal glucose: increase caloric intake to 100 %
- check triglycerides twice per week, high tg increase risk of pancreatitis
- check phosphate in severe malnutrition or in alcoholism
  - normal phosphate: increase intake to 100 %
  - low phosphate: lower intake to 25 %, substitute phosphate
- aim for 100 % intake on day 7

## Enteral Nutrition

- aim for enteral nutrition to reduce risk for catheter associated infections
- if nasogastric/orogastric tube is not feasible, consider PEG
- Contraindications:
  - disruptions of enteral motility (ileus, etc.)
  - disruption of gastric emptying (consider postpyloric tube)
  - severe uncontrolled hypoxemia, hypercapnia, acidosis
  - absorption deficiency
- consider starting with water, use low flow rate in the beginning (start with 10-20 ml/h)

## Protein deficiency

- causes: malnutrition, alcoholism, nephrotic syndrome, etc.
- protein-intake:
  - BMI < 30: 1.0 g protein (= 1.2 g amino acids)/kg weight (= current weight â€” hyperhydration)
  - BMI > 30: 1.5 g protein (= 1.8 g amino acids)/kg weight (= ideal weight)
  - some articles recommend higher substitution depending on need
- albumin: will be metabolized, use for volume stabilization
- use bcaa (amino hepa, etc. for volume substitution)

## Laboratory checks

- Blood glucose every few hours
- Triglycerides 2x/week
- Phosphate 1-2/day
- BUN (= Urea concentration * 0.467 [mg/dl]), increase without corresponding increase in creatinine might indicate too high protein intake. Recommended by some societies for BMI > 30.
- Lactate, increase can indicate thiamine deficiency (e.g. in alcoholism)
- liver enzymes, increase might indicate refeeding syndrome
- albumin, low albumin might indicate protein deficiency.
- vitamin D and calcium
