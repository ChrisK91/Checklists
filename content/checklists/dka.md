Diabetic ketoacidosis is a severe and potential life-threatening complication of diabetic mellitus. Glucose levels are usually moderately elevated, however they can range from normal/slightly increased levels (euglycemic states) to high levels exceeding 900 mg/dl in comatose patients. The treatment relies on fluid & electrolyte replacement, insulin administration and glucose administration.

Guidelines of from different regions have variations in therapy, for instance the ADA suggests half-isotonic (0.45 %) saline in the fluid replacement regime, the Joint British Diabetes Society and the German guideline recommend 0.9 % in almost all cases. In the European pediatric guidelines, the use of "a solution with
a tonicity ≥0.45 %" is recommended, stating that 0.9 % or 0.45 % with added potassium can be used. Due to the various recommendations, the reader is advised to also consult local hospital guidelines on fluid therapy.

## Diagnosis

- **D**: elevated blood glucose levels or known diabetes mellitus
- **K**: elevated blood ketone concentration or significant ketonuria
- **A**: low bicarbonate (< 15 mmol/l) and/or pH < 7.3

When treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, the resulting glucosuria can minimize the developing hyperglycemia.

DKA can develop due to insulin deficiency. In non insulin-dependent patients however (i.e. d.m. type 2 with remaining insulin production) the DKA has often an underlying cause that needs to be identified, including infection, trauma, mediation, etc.

## Management

- regular monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, GCS
- regular monitoring of glucose, venous or arterial BG (pH, bicarbonate, base excess, anion gap), Na, K
- central line if needed, peripheral lines might have a larger diameter depending on available equipment
- urinary catheter for measuring urinary output reliably

## Fluids and Electrolytes

- first hour:
  - in hypovolemic shock: isotonic saline or balanced crystalloid as fast as possible (e.g. 500 ml/10 min), involve critical care
  - in hypovolemia (RR > 90 mmHg): 1,000 ml/60min of isotonic saline or balanced crystalloid
  - in euvolemia: guide volume by clinical assessment
- after second or third hour:
  - further infusion with 200 to 500 ml/h depending on hemodynamics
    - Success criteria: improved blood pressure, improved urinary output
- Potassium:
  - < 3.3 mmol/l: **don't give insulin**, correct potassium, e.g. with 20 to 40 mEq/l of fluid
  - 3.3 – 5.3 mmol/l: add 20 to 40 mEq to each liter, aim for 4–5 mmol/l
  - 5.3 mmol/l: delay potassium until values fall below this level

## Insulin and Glucose

- Patients with existing insulin medication:
  - Insulin pumps should be stopped and removed, it might not work correctly
  - Long acting insulin (glargine, detemir, deglutec) should continue at usual dose and time
- Insulin infusion
  - If patient is not hypokalemic, start insulin immediately
  - initial bolus is *generally not recommended*, can be considered if patient severly acidotic or continuous infusion not immediately available
    - 10 units i.v.
- fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion
  - start with 0.1 U/kg/h (max. 15 U/kg/h)
  - **Stay on target**:
    - decrease glucose by 50 mg/dl/hour
    - increase bicarbonate by 3 mmol/l/hr
    - decrease blood ketones by 0.5 mmol/l/hr
    - potassium between 4.0 and 5.5 mmol/l
  - if correction too slow: increase rate by 1 U/h
    - check connections to be sure, that insulin is delivered. Remove IV filters that may bind insulin.
    - UpToDate states a doubling of infusion rate can be used
  - when glucose falls to 200 – 300 mg/dl consider reducing rate to 0.02 to 0.05 units/kg/h
    - glucose should not fall below 200 mg/dl
- intravenous glucose
  - once serum glucose is 200 – 300 mg/dl i.v dextrose is needed as additional substrate
    - consider cutting fluid rate in half and add the same amount of dextrose (e.g. 200 ml/h saline ⇾ 100 ml/h saline + 100 ml/h dextrose 10%)
- continue insulin and i.v dextrose until patient is eating and drinking normally
  - patient should have received long acting insulin 1 to 2 hours before stopping
- if patient has newly diagnosed diabetes
  - start long acting insulin with 0.25 U/kg s.c. daily
